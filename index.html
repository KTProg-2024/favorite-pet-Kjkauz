      <h2> - Dogs </h2>
      <h3> Canis lupus familiaris </h3>
      <br> 
      I like dogs because they are friendly to their owners and are a very loyal pet.

      <h2> - Bengal Cats </h2>
      <h3> Felis catus × Prionailurus bengalensis </h3>
      I like cats in general, but the Bengal cats i like more beacuse they look similar to leopards, and they are also hypoallergenic.

      <h2> - Chickens </h2>
      <h3> Gallus gallus domesticus </h3>
      Chickens are a fun bird to have around if you have a big yard, they are friendly and funny to watch, plus every now and then you'll get an egg or two.

      <h2> - Rabbits </h2>
      <h3> Oryctolagus cuniculus </h3>
      Rabbits are a fun, lowkey pet to own, they have low management so you dont need to pay a lot of attention to them, but they are also very comforting.

      <h2> - Hamsters </h2>
      <h3> Cricetinae </h3>
      Hamsters are another low management pet to own, but they are also very fun to play with and funny to watch. My favorite thing to see when i see a hamster is when they stuff their cheaks as full as they can.
